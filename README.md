# DevHack - Web Portal.

Built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to leverage server side rendering. Used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for auth, database and hosting.

## Development

* `npm start` to build and view the site on `localhost:8000`
* `npm run build` to build to static assets

The repository has CI/CD activated. Every commit pushed to `master` is built and deployed. You can have a look 
at the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file for the CI spec.
